                        <p>I began researching more creative jobs I could do with my skills and found Product Design, so I started to educate myself on the end-to-end product design process. I took a few boot camps to obtain structure fundamentals for a better user experience. After, I recognized that my skills better aligned with identifying a need, how it can help the business, championing the product, and collaborating to turn vision into reality. I love the technical aspect; however, I am more interested in strategy or piecing things together. I want to strengthen my understanding of user needs, learn new market research techniques, and create a shared brain across teams to help align with stakeholders. I am passionate about contributing to product failure reduction and building a robust product sense.<br>
